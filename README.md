# Open-banking-Aggregator
Platform for the users to perform transactions across multiple banks, built over NodeJs server

The PSD2 (Payment Service Directive) came into force in January 2016 in the European countries.
The objectives of PSD2 are to make the payments safer, increase the consumer protection, and making
an increasingly integrated banking system which integrates all major banks for information sharing
and instant inter-bank transactions
Thus ensuring a level playing field for all players, including the new ones.

The project is an aggregator which takes dummy data of user from the database (mongo) and simulates the
actual bank transactions and other basic functionalities.
